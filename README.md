# MathLibrary
This project is my attempt to create a library containing implementations of advanced mathematical formulas. It is going to be developed until June 2023.

So far my library contains:
- Lagrange Interpolation Formula
- Polynomial evaluation (for polynmials in general form)
- Horner's Method for polynomial evaluation
- Newton's Interpolation Formula
